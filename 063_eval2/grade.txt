Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2 story-step3 story-step4 story-step1.o story-step2.o story-step3.o story-step4.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Line_1_did_not_match
Line_2_did_not_match
Your file did not match the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

Once upon a time, there was a  who lived in a very 	      |	Once upon a time, there was a cat who lived in a very cat
. 							      |	cat.
