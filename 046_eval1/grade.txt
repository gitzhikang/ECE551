 This test case will run 
 launches-step1 
 With arguments 
 wiredinput.txt 
-------------------------
I need to compile your code for launches-step1 (make launches-step1)

Compiling launches-step1
rm -f iter_target.o myinput.o planet_util.o step1.o step2.o step3.o step4.o target.o *~ launches-step? launches-step4-debug
